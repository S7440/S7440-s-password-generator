# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

A password generator that creates a unique password through random character generation. Think googles suggest a strong password function... but make it clunky.


## Installation

Just input the url I mean the browser does the work for you.

## Usage

In order to get your fun lil password generator to work just click the button. We've done all the work for you.

## Credits

Andrew Mason helped me figure out how to put it all together. Without their help I probably would've just banged my head on my keyboard until code came out or csf.

W3 schools and Mimo also came in clutch with teaching me why things work the way things work. Unfortunately they can't help me crippling indecision.

## Features

clicky button, I really wanted to style it so it actually looks clicky but I'm not sure if thats a risk I'm willing to take so really the only real feature is password generation.
